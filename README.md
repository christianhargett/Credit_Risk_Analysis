# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview

In this project we are working with LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company. LendingClub has tasked us with building a Machine Learning model that predicts credit risk when given a certain loan dataset. We have utilized libraries from SciKit Learn in order to assess different Machine Learning algorithms and determine the best model for the client.
